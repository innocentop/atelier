\noindent The Lord’s revelation to my \uline{Master:}~†~\nopagebreak

“Sit \uline{on} my right:~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

your foes I will put be\uline{neath} your feet.”

\noindent The Lord will wield from \uline{Zion}~†~\nopagebreak

your scep\uline{ter} of power:~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

rule in the midst of \uline{all} your foes.

\noindent A prince from the day of your \uline{birth}~†~\nopagebreak

on the \uline{ho}ly mountains;~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

from the womb before the dawn \uline{I} begot you.

\noindent The Lord has sworn an oath he will not \uline{change}.~†~\nopagebreak

“You are a \uline{priest} for ever,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

a priest like Melchize\uline{dek} of old.”

\noindent The Master standing at \uline{your} right hand~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

will shatter kings in the day of \uline{his} great wrath.

\noindent He shall drink from the stream \uline{by} the wayside~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

and therefore he shall lift \uline{up} his head.

\noindent Glory to the Father, and \uline{to} the Son,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

and to the \uline{Ho}ly Spirit:

\noindent as it was in the begin\uline{ning}, is now,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

and will be for ev\uline{er}. Amen.
