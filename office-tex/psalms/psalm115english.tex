\noindent I trusted, even when I said:~$\star$~\nopagebreak

``I am sorely afflicted,"

\noindent and when I said in my alarm:~$\star$~\nopagebreak

``No man can be trusted."

\noindent How can I repay the Lord~$\star$~\nopagebreak

for his goodness to me?

\noindent The cup of salvation I will raise;~$\star$~\nopagebreak

I will call on the Lord’s name.

\noindent My vows to the Lord I will fulfill~$\star$~\nopagebreak

before all his people.

\noindent O precious in the eyes of the Lord~$\star$~\nopagebreak

is the death of his faithful.

\noindent Your servant, Lord, your servant am I;~$\star$~\nopagebreak

you have loosened my bonds.

\noindent A thanksgiving sacrifice I make;~$\star$~\nopagebreak

I will call on the Lord’s name.

\noindent My vows to the Lord I will fulfill~$\star$~\nopagebreak

before all his people,

\noindent in the courts of the house of the Lord,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

in your midst, O Jerusalem.

\noindent Glory to the Father, and to the Son,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

and to the Holy Spirit:

\noindent as it was in the beginning, is now,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

and will be for ever. Amen.
