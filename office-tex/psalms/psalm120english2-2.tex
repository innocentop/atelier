\noindent I lift up my eyes to \uline{the} mountains:~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

from where shall come \uline{my} help?

\noindent My help shall come from \uline{the} Lord~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

who made heaven \uline{and} earth.

\noindent May he never allow you \uline{to} stumble!~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

Let him sleep not, \uline{your} guard.

\noindent No, he sleeps not \uline{nor} slumbers,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

Isra\uline{el’s} guard.

\noindent The Lord is your guard and \uline{your} shade;~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

at your right side \uline{he} stands.

\noindent By day the sun shall \uline{not} smite you~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

nor the moon in \uline{the} night.

\noindent The Lord will guard you \uline{from} evil,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

he will guard \uline{your} soul.

\noindent The Lord will guard your going \uline{and} coming~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

both now and \uline{for} ever.

\noindent Glory to the Father, and to \uline{the} Son,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

and to the Ho\uline{ly} Spirit:

\noindent as it was in the beginning, \uline{is} now,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

and will be for ever. \uline{A}men.
