\noindent O God, save me by your name;~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

by your power, uphold my cause.

\noindent O God, hear my prayer;~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

listen to the words of my mouth.

\noindent For proud men have risen against me,~â€ ~\nopagebreak

ruthless men seek my life.~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

They have no regard for God.

\noindent But I have God for my help.~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

The Lord upholds my life.

\noindent I will sacrifice to you with willing heart~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

and praise your name for it is good:

\noindent for you have rescued me from all my distress~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

and my eyes have seen the downfall of my foes.

\noindent Glory to the Father, and to the Son,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

and to the Holy Spirit:

\noindent as it was in the beginning, is now,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

and will be for ever. Amen.
