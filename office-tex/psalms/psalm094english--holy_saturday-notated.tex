\noindent The Lord is God, the mighty God, 

\noindent   the great king over all the gods.

\noindent He holds in his hands the depths of the earth 

\noindent   and the highest mountains as well.

\noindent He made the sea; it belongs to him, 

\noindent   the dry land, too, for it was formed by his hands.

\noindent Come, then, let us bow down and worship, 

\noindent   bending the knee before the Lord, our maker.

\noindent For he is our God and we are his people, 

\noindent   the flock he shepherds.

\noindent Today, listen to the voice of the Lord:

\noindent Do not grow stubborn, as your fathers did in the wilderness, 

\noindent when at Meriba and Massah they challenged me and provoked me, 

\noindent Although they had seen all of my works.  

\vspace{5pt}

\noindent Forty years I endured that generation. 

\noindent I said, “They are a people whose hearts go astray

and they do not know my ways.”

\noindent So I swore in my anger,

\noindent   “They shall not enter into my rest.”  

\vspace{5pt}

\noindent Glory to the Father, and to the Son, 

\noindent and to the Holy Spirit:

\noindent as it was in the beginning, is now, 

\noindent and will be for ever. Amen.
