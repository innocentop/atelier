\lettrine[loversize=0.15,lines=2]{J}{}esus Christ is worthy of all praise, for he was appointed high priest among men and their representative before God. We honor him and in our weakness we pray: \Rbar. Bring salvation to your people, Lord.
\par \Rbar. Bring salvation to your people, Lord.

You marvelously illuminated your Church through distinguished leaders and holy men and women,
– let Christians rejoice always in such splendor.
\par \Rbar. Bring salvation to your people, Lord.

You forgave the sins of your people when their holy leaders like Moses sought your compassion,
– through their intercession continue to purify and sanctify your holy people.
\par \Rbar. Bring salvation to your people, Lord.

In the midst of their brothers and sisters you anointed your holy ones and filled them with the Holy Spirit,
– fill all the leaders of your people with the same Spirit.
\par \Rbar. Bring salvation to your people, Lord.

You yourself are the only visible possession of our holy pastors,
– let none of them, won at the price of your blood, remain far from you.
\par \Rbar. Bring salvation to your people, Lord.

The shepherds of your Church keep your flock from being snatched out of your hand. Through them you give your flock eternal life,
– save those who have died, those for whom you gave up your life.
\par \Rbar. Bring salvation to your people, Lord.
