\noindent Happy the man who fears the Lord,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

who takes delight in all his commands.

\noindent His sons will be powerful on earth;~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

the children of the upright are blessed.

\noindent Riches and wealth are in his house;~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

his justice stands firm for ever.

\noindent He is a light in the darkness for the upright:~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

he is generous, merciful and just.

\noindent The good man takes pity and lends,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

he conducts his affairs with honor.

\noindent The just man will never waver:~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

he will be remembered for ever.

\noindent He has no fear of evil news;~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

with a firm heart he trusts in the Lord.

\noindent With a steadfast heart he will not fear;~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

he will see the downfall of his foes.

\noindent Open-handed, he gives to the poor;~†~\nopagebreak

his justice stands firm for ever.~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

His head will be raised in glory.

\noindent The wicked man sees and is angry,~†~\nopagebreak

grinds his teeth and fades away;~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

the desire of the wicked leads to doom.

\noindent Glory to the Father, and to the Son,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

and to the Holy Spirit:

\noindent as it was in the beginning, is now,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

and will be for ever. Amen.
