\lettrine[lines=3,loversize=0.15]{C}{hrist} must reign until God has put all enemies under his feet, and the last enemy to be destroyed is death. Scripture reads that God “has placed all things under his feet.” But when it says that everything has been made subject, it is clear that he who has made everything subject to Christ is excluded. When, finally, all has been subjected to the Son, he will then subject himself to the One who made all things subject to him, so that God may be all in all.
