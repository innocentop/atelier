– that they may inspire in your people the hope of being transfigured at the last day.

O Christ, upon the mountaintop you let the light of your face shine over Moses and Elijah,
– we ask your blessing upon the Jewish people; of old you called them to be your chosen nation.
\par \Rbar. Lord, in your light may we see light.

O Christ, you gave light to the world when the glory of the Creator arose over you,
– we pray for men of good will that they may walk in your light.

O Christ, you will reform our lowly body and make it like your glorious one,
– we pray for our brothers and sisters who have died that they may share in your glory for ever.
