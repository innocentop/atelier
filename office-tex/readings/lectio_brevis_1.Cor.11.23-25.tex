\lettrine[lines=3]{I}{} received from the Lord what I handed on to you, namely, that the Lord Jesus on the night in which he was betrayed took bread, and after he had given thanks, broke it and said, ``This is my body, which is for you. Do this in remembrance of me." In the same way, after the supper, he took the cup, saying, ``This cup is the new covenant in my blood. Do this, whenever you drink it, in remembrance of me."
