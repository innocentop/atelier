\lettrine[lines=3]{O}{} God, who through the fruitful virginity of Blessed Mary
bestowed on the human race
the grace of eternal salvation,
grant, we pray,
that we may experience the intercession of her,
through whom we were found worthy
to receive the author of life,
our Lord Jesus Christ your Son.
Who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
one God, for ever and ever. \par \Rbar. Amen.
