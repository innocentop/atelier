\noindent I have called to you, Lord; hasten \uline{to} help me!~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

Hear my voice when I \uline{cry} to you.

\noindent Let my prayer arise before you \uline{like} incense,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

the raising of my hands like an eve\uline{ning} oblation.

\noindent Set, O Lord, a guard over \uline{my} mouth;~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

keep watch at the door \uline{of} my lips!

\noindent Do not turn my heart to things that \uline{are} wrong,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

to evil deeds with men \uline{who} are sinners.

\noindent Never allow me to share in \uline{their} feasting.~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

If a good man strikes or reproves me \uline{it} is kindness;

\noindent but let the oil of the wicked not anoint \uline{my} head.~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

Let my prayer be ever a\uline{gainst} their malice.

\noindent Their princes were thrown down by the side of \uline{the} rock:~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

then they understood that my \uline{words} were kind.

\noindent As a millstone is shattered to pieces on \uline{the} ground,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

so their bones were strewn at the mouth \uline{of} the grave.

\noindent To you, Lord God, my eyes \uline{are} turned:~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

in you I take refuge; \uline{spare} my soul!

\noindent From the trap they have laid for me keep \uline{me} safe:~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

keep me from the snares of those \uline{who} do evil.

\noindent Glory to the Father, and to \uline{the} Son,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

and to the \uline{Ho}ly Spirit:

\noindent as it was in the beginning, \uline{is} now,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

and will be for ev\uline{er}. Amen.
