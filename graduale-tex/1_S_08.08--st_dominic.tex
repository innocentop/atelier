In the heavenly hierarchy, let there sound a new harmony, produced in a new canticle. \par 2. And let the melody of our choir on this Earth agree therewith, rejoicing with Dominic. \par 3. From the waste of Egypt the Creator of The world called the man of His decree. On the ark of poverty he fords the Stream of vanity for the salvation of souls. \par 3. Under the figure of a hound the Preacher of the world is shown beforehand To his mother. Bearing in his mouth a Torch, he exhorts all to the law of love. \par 4. He is a new law-giver, he is the Imitator of Elias and a detester of crimes. He scatters the foxes of Samson and With the trumpet of Gedeon he puts to Flight the hosts of the enemy. \par 5. While yet alive in body he restores to a Mother her son recalled from the dead. A storm bows to his sign of the Cross. The company of the brethren eats bread Sent as a gift of God. \par 6. The blessed man, in whom all the Church now takes joy, is exalted. He fills the world with his seed, And at last is located in the army Of heaven. \par 7. The grain of wheat lies hidden, the Star lurks concealed; but the Maker Of all things commands the bones Of Joseph to germinate and the star to Radiate for the salvation of souls. \par 8. O how the fragrance of his tomb Surpassing every aroma, proves the Bloom of his flesh! The sick come With haste and are cured, the blind and The lame are made whole by the Repetition of his power. \par 9. Wherefore let us sound forth with Full voice our praises to the great Saint Dominic. O people of need, as you follow In his footsteps, call on him to Intercede. \par 10. But do you, O loving father, good Shepherd and defender of your flock, Commend at the court of the great King by your constant prayer the Concerns of your forsaken sheep. Amen. Alleluia!} \newpage
