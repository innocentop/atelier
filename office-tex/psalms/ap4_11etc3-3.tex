\noindent O Lord our God, \uline{you} are worthy ~$\star$~\nopagebreak

to receive glory and hon\uline{or} and power.

\noindent For you have creat\uline{ed} all things; ~$\star$~\nopagebreak

by your will they came to be \uline{and} were made.

\noindent Worthy are \uline{you,} O Lord, ~$\star$~\nopagebreak

to receive the scroll and break o\uline{pen} its seals.

\noindent For \uline{you} were slain; ~$\star$~\nopagebreak

with your blood you pur\uline{chased} for God

\noindent men of every \uline{race} and tongue, ~$\star$~\nopagebreak

of every peo\uline{ple} and nation.

\noindent You made of them a \uline{kingdom},~†~\nopagebreak

and priests to \uline{serve} our God, ~$\star$~\nopagebreak

and they shall reign \uline{on} the earth.

\noindent Worthy is the Lamb \uline{that} was slain ~$\star$~\nopagebreak

to receive pow\uline{er} and riches,

\noindent wis\uline{dom} and strength, ~$\star$~\nopagebreak

honor and glo\uline{ry} and praise.

\noindent Glory to the Father, and \uline{to} the Son,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

and to the \uline{Ho}ly Spirit:

\noindent as it was in the begin\uline{ning}, is now,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

and will be for ev\uline{er}. Amen.
