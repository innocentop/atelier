\noindent I trusted, even when \uline{I} said:~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

``I am sore\uline{ly} afflicted,"

\noindent and when I said in my \uline{a}larm:~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

``No man \uline{can} be trusted."

\noindent How can I repay \uline{the} Lord~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

for his good\uline{ness} to me?

\noindent The cup of salvation I \uline{will} raise;~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

I will call on \uline{the} Lord’s name.

\noindent My vows to the Lord I will \uline{ful}fill~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

before \uline{all} his people.

\noindent O precious in the eyes of \uline{the} Lord~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

is the death \uline{of} his faithful.

\noindent Your servant, Lord, your servant \uline{am} I;~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

you have loos\uline{ened} my bonds.

\noindent A thanksgiving sacrifice \uline{I} make:~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

I will call on \uline{the} Lord’s name.

\noindent My vows to the Lord I will \uline{ful}fill~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

before \uline{all} his people,

\noindent in the courts of the house of \uline{the} Lord,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

in your midst, \uline{O} Jerusalem.

\noindent Glory to the Father, and to \uline{the} Son,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

and to the \uline{Ho}ly Spirit:

\noindent as it was in the beginning, \uline{is} now,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

and will be for ev\uline{er}. Amen.
