\noindent Though he was in the form of \uline{God}, ~†~\nopagebreak

Jesus did not deem equali\uline{ty} with God ~$\star$~\nopagebreak

something \uline{to} be grasped at.

\noindent Rather, he emptied him\uline{self} ~†~\nopagebreak

and took the form \uline{of} a slave, ~$\star$~\nopagebreak

being born in the like\uline{ness} of men.

\noindent He was known to be of hu\uline{man} estate, ~$\star$~\nopagebreak

and it was thus that he hum\uline{bled} himself,

\noindent obediently accepting \uline{e}ven death, ~$\star$~\nopagebreak

death \uline{on} a cross!

\noindent Be\uline{cause} of this, ~$\star$~\nopagebreak

God high\uline{ly} exalted him

\noindent and bestowed on \uline{him} the name ~$\star$~\nopagebreak

above every \uline{oth}er name,

\noindent So that at \uline{Je}sus’ name ~$\star$~\nopagebreak

every \uline{knee} must bend

\noindent in the heavens, \uline{on} the earth, ~$\star$~\nopagebreak

and un\uline{der} the earth,

\noindent and every tongue pro\uline{claim} ~†~\nopagebreak

to the glory of \uline{God} the Father: ~$\star$~\nopagebreak

JESUS \uline{CHRIST} IS LORD!

\noindent Glory to the Father, and \uline{to} the Son,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

and to the \uline{Ho}ly Spirit:

\noindent as it was in the begin\uline{ning}, is now,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

and will be for ev\uline{er}. Amen.
