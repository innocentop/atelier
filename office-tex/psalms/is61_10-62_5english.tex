\noindent I rejoice heartily in the Lord,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

in my God is the joy of my soul;

\noindent for he has clothed me with a robe of salvation,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

and wrapped me in a mantle of justice,

\noindent like a bridegroom adorned with a diadem,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

like a bride bedecked with her jewels.

\noindent As the earth brings forth its plants,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

and a garden makes its growth spring up,

\noindent so will the Lord God make justice and praise~$\star$~\nopagebreak

spring up before all the nations.

\noindent For Zion’s sake I will not be silent,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

for Jerusalem’s sake I will not be quiet,

\noindent until her vindication shines forth like the dawn~$\star$~\nopagebreak

and her victory like a burning torch.

\noindent Nations shall behold your vindication,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

and all kings your glory;

\noindent you shall be called by a new name~$\star$~\nopagebreak

pronounced by the mouth of the Lord.

\noindent You shall be a glorious crown in the hand of the Lord,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

a royal diadem held by your God.

\noindent No more shall men call you “Forsaken,”~$\star$~\nopagebreak

or your land “Desolate,”

\noindent but you shall be called “My Delight,”~$\star$~\nopagebreak

and your land “Espoused.”

\noindent For the Lord delights in you,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

and makes your land his spouse.

\noindent As a young man marries a virgin,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

your Builder shall marry you;

\noindent and as a bridegroom rejoices in his bride~$\star$~\nopagebreak

so shall your God rejoice in you.

\noindent Glory to the Father, and to the Son,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

and to the Holy Spirit:

\noindent as it was in the beginning, is now,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

and will be for ever. Amen.
