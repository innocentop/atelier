\noindent God is made known in Judah;~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

in Israel his name is great.

\noindent He set up his tent in Jerusalem~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

and his dwelling place in Zion.

\noindent It was there he broke the flashing arrows,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

the shield, the sword, the armor.

\noindent You, O Lord, are resplendent,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

more majestic than the everlasting mountains.

\noindent The warriors, despoiled, slept in death;~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

the hands of the soldiers were powerless.

\noindent At your threat, O God of Jacob,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

horse and rider lay stunned.

\noindent You, you alone, strike terror.~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

Who shall stand when your anger is roused?

\noindent You uttered your sentence from the heavens;~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

the earth in terror was still

\noindent when God arose to judge,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

to save the humble of the earth.

\noindent Menâ€™s anger will serve to praise you;~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

its survivors surround you in joy.

\noindent Make vows to your God and fulfill them.~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

Let all pay tribute to him who strikes terror,

\noindent who cuts short the life of princes,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

who strikes terror in the kings of the earth.

\noindent Glory to the Father, and to the Son,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

and to the Holy Spirit:

\noindent as it was in the beginning, is now,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

and will be for ever. Amen.
