\lettrine[loversize=0.15,lines=2]{T}{hus} says the Lord, \\In their affliction, they shall look for me:\\
   “Come, let us return to the Lord,\\
For it is he who has rent, but he will heal us;\\
   he has struck us, but he will bind our wounds.\\
He will revive us after two days;\\
   on the third day he will raise us up,\\
   to live in his presence.”
