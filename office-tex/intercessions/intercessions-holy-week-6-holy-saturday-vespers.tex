Lord Jesus, when your side was pierced, there flowed out blood and water, the marvelous symbol of the whole Church,\par
— through your death, burial and resurrection, bring life to your bride, the Church.

Lord Jesus, you remembered those who did not remember your promise of resurrection,\par
— remember those without hope, who do not know that you have risen.

\vspace{3pt}

Lamb of God, you were offered for all as our paschal sacrifice,\par
— draw all mankind to yourself.

\vspace{3pt}


God of all the world, you encompass the universe but were pleased to be laid in a tomb,\par
— free the human race from the powers of darkness, and grant it the gift of immortal glory.

Christ, Son of the living God, you opened the gates of paradise to the repentant thief,\par
— gather all who have shared your death and burial into the glory of your resurrection.
