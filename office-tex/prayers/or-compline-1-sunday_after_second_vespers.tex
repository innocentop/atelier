\lettrine[loversize=0.15,lines=2]{L}{}ord,
we have celebrated today
the mystery of the rising of Christ to new life.
May we now rest in your peace,
safe from all that could harm us,
and rise again refreshed and joyful,
to praise you throughout another day.
We ask this through Christ our Lord.
\par \Rbar. Amen.
