\noindent I trusted, even when \uline{I} said:~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

``I am sorely \uline{af}flicted,"

\noindent and when I said in my \uline{a}larm:~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

``No man can \uline{be} trusted."

\noindent How can I repay \uline{the} Lord~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

for his goodness \uline{to} me?

\noindent The cup of salvation I \uline{will} raise;~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

I will call on \uline{the} Lord’s name.

\noindent My vows to the Lord I will \uline{ful}fill~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

before all \uline{his} people.

\noindent O precious in the eyes of \uline{the} Lord~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

is the death of \uline{his} faithful.

\noindent Your servant, Lord, your servant \uline{am} I;~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

you have loosened \uline{my} bonds.

\noindent A thanksgiving sacrifice \uline{I} make:~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

I will call on \uline{the} Lord’s name.

\noindent My vows to the Lord I will \uline{ful}fill~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

before all \uline{his} people,

\noindent in the courts of the house of \uline{the} Lord,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

in your midst, O \uline{Je}rusalem.

\noindent Glory to the Father, and to \uline{the} Son,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

and to the Ho\uline{ly} Spirit:

\noindent as it was in the beginning, \uline{is} now,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

and will be for ever. \uline{A}men.
