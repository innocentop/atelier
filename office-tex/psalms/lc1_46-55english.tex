\lettrine[loversize=0.15,lines=2]{M}{y} soul proclaims the greatness of the Lord,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak \par \hspace{10pt} my spirit rejoices in God my Savior

\noindent for he has looked with favor on his lowly servant.~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

From this day all generations will call me blessed:

\noindent the Almighty has done great things for me,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

and holy is his Name.

\noindent He has mercy on those who fear him~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

in every generation.

\noindent He has shown the strength of his arm,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

he has scattered the proud in their conceit.

\noindent He has cast down the mighty from their thrones,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

and has lifted up the lowly.

\noindent He has filled the hungry with good things,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

and the rich he has sent away empty.

\noindent He has come to the help of his servant Israel~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

for he has remembered his promise of mercy,

\noindent the promise he made to our fathers,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

to Abraham and his children for ever.

\noindent Glory to the Father, and to the Son,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

and to the Holy Spirit:

\noindent as it was in the beginning, is now,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

and will be for ever. Amen.
