\lettrine[lines=2]{S}{}ee, my servant shall prosper,\par
   he shall be raised high and greatly exalted.\par
\noindent Even as many were amazed at him—\par
   so marred was his look beyond that of man,\par
   and his appearance beyond that of mortals—\par
\noindent So shall he startle many nations,\par
   because of him kings shall stand speechless;\par
\noindent For those who have not been told shall see,\par
   those who have not heard shall ponder it.
