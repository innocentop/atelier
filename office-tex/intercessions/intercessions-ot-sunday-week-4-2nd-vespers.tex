\Rbar. Lord, hear our prayer.

Father and Lord of all, you sent your Son into the world, that your name might be glorified in every place,
– strengthen the witness of your Church among the nations.
\par \Rbar. Lord, hear our prayer.

Make us obedient to the teachings of your apostles,
– and bound to the truth of our faith.
\par \Rbar. Lord, hear our prayer.

As you love the innocent,
– render justice to those who are wronged.
\par \Rbar. Lord, hear our prayer.

Free those in bondage and give sight to the blind,
– raise up the fallen and protect the stranger.
\par \Rbar. Lord, hear our prayer.

Fulfill your promise to those who already sleep in your peace,
– through your Son grant them a blessed resurrection.
\par \Rbar. Lord, hear our prayer.
