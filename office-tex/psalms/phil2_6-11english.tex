\noindent Though he was in the form of God,~†~\nopagebreak

Jesus did not deem equality with God~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

something to be grasped at.

\noindent Rather, he emptied himself~†~\nopagebreak

and took the form of a slave,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

being born in the likeness of men.

\noindent He was known to be of human estate,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

and it was thus that he humbled himself,

\noindent obediently accepting even death,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

death on a cross!

\noindent Because of this,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

God highly exalted him

\noindent and bestowed on him the name~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

above every other name,

\noindent So that at Jesus’ name~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

every knee must bend

\noindent in the heavens, on the earth,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

and under the earth,

\noindent and every tongue proclaim~†~\nopagebreak

to the glory of God the Father:~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

\textsc{Jesus Christ is Lord!}

\noindent Glory to the Father, and to the Son,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

and to the Holy Spirit:

\noindent as it was in the beginning, is now,~\GreStar{}~\nopagebreak

and will be for ever. Amen.
